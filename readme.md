# My-levelDB
this project is a practice method about to learning database and rust.
It's one by one copy project from leveldb-rs.

**Goalï¼š** A fully compatible implementation of levelDB in Rust.

The implementation is very close to the original; often, you can see the same algorithm translated 1:1, and class (struct) and methods names are similar or the same.


## Status

* User-facing methods exist: Read/Write/Delete; snapshots; iteration
* Compaction is supported, including manual ones.
* Fully synchronous: Efficiency gains by using non-atomic types, but writes may
  occasionally block during a compaction. In --release mode, an average compaction
  takes 0.2-0.5 seconds.
* Compatible with the original implementation. If it isn't (crash/read error/write error), it's a bug and needs to be fixed.
* Performance is decent; while not quite up to par with the original (we don't use multithreading, for example) it is very much usable.

## Goals

Some of the goals of this implementation are

* As few copies of data as possible; most of the time, slices of bytes (`&[u8]`)
  are used. Owned memory is represented as `Vec<u8>` (and then possibly borrowed
  as slice). Zero-copy is not always possible, though, and sometimes simplicity is favored.
* Correctness -- self-checking implementation, good test coverage, etc. Just
  like the original implementation.
* Clarity; commented code, clear structure (hopefully doing a better job than
  the original implementation).
* Coming close-ish to the original implementation; clarifying the translation of
  typical C++ constructs to Rust.
